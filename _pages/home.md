# introduction

We are excited to announce the "Knowledge-Based Compositional Generalization (KBCG)"" workshop at the IJCAI 2023. The workshop aims to bring together researchers from academia and industry to discuss the latest advances and challenges in the area of knowledge-based compositional generalization in AI. Compositional generalization, the ability to understand and generate new combinations of previously learned concepts, is a fundamental problem in AI. It is particularly important in areas such as natural language understanding, reinforcement learning, and knowledge representation. However, achieving compositional generalization remains a challenging problem in AI.

The ability to make **generalizations** based on different actions or concepts, known as systematic compositionality, is crucial for human learning and understanding. It allows us to understand and learn new things, even when we have limited experience. In human daily life, we often encounter problems that require us to be able to make generalizations based on compositions of different actions or concepts. This ability is critical for how we are able to learn and understand new things, even when we have limited experience. However, while there have been significant advances in the language capabilities of machines, they still struggle with generalization and require large amounts of training data. These machine learning techniques, like neural networks, have been criticized in the past for lacking systematic compositionality. For a recent survey on compositional generalization: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01067](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01067).

We believe that incorporating knowledge can potentially solve many of the most pressing challenges tackling the compositional generalization in deep learning today. The primary goal of this workshop is to facilitate community building: we hope to bring researchers together to consolidate this line of research and foster collaboration in the community.At our workshop, we will bring together researchers from these various subfields to discuss the success of score-based methods, and identify common challenges across different research areas. We will also explore the potential for applying score-based methods to even more real-world applications, including in computer vision, signal processing, and computational chemistry. By doing so, we hope to folster collaboration among researchers and build a more cohesive research community focused on score-based methods.

This workshop will be an **in-person event** at [IJCAI 2023](https://ijcai-23.org/), taking place on **Aug 19-25th 2023** at Cape Town, South Africa . The session will cover invited talks, contributed talks, posters, and a panel discussion.
