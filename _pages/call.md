# Key dates

* Submission deadline: **April 26th, 2023 (11:59 pm AOE)**
* Acceptance notification: **June 1st, 2022**
* Camera ready for accepted submissions: **June 15th, 2022**

# Topics

We invite researchers in AI, machine learning, statistics, cognitive sciences and neuroscience to submit their latest work to the IJCAI 2022 workshop on knowledge-based compositional generalization.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for researchers to present their latest work on knowledge-based compositional generalization and to foster discussions on the challenges and opportunities in this area. We invite researchers in AI, machine learning, statistics, cognitive sciences and neuroscience to submit their papers, posters, and demonstrations on any topic related to knowledge-based compositional generalization, including but not limited to:

- Representational learning, Meta-learning, Transfer learning, Reinforcement learning, Self-supervised learning for compositional generalization
- Reasoning, commonsense and knowledge representation for compositional generalization
- Applications of compositional generalization such as foundation models, natural language
  processing, computer vision, and control systems
- Methods to learn compositional representations
- Combining knowledge from multiple sources and modalities
- Relational and causal machine Learning
- Using external knowledge for efficient machine learning
- Symbol grounding and Abstractions
- Neuro-inspired AI
- Neuro-symbolic AI
- Compositionality in reinforcement learning
- Benchmarks for compositional generalization
- Data visualization to study compositionality

We also welcome submissions from researchers working on related topics such as neural program synthesis, program
induction, and concept learning.

# Instructions

Submissions should be in the form of a 7-page papers (+2-page references) for proceeding articles or a 2-page abstract for posters/demonstrations, and should be formatted according to the conferenceâ€™s guidelines (https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and included in a workshop proceeding.

All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as posters. The program committee will select a few papers for oral presentation. There will be a poster session during the scheduled coffee breaks to facilitate and spark discussions amongst attendees.

We look forward to your submissions and to seeing you at the workshop. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the organizing committee.

The submission website is on **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ijcai.org/IJCAI/2023/Workshop/KBCG)**. Camera-ready versions are due by **June 15, 2023**, and will be posted on the workshop website.
