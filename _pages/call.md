# topics

We invite researchers in AI, machine learning, statistics, cognitive sciences and neuroscience to submit their latest work to the IJCAI 2022 workshop on knowledge-based compositional generalization.

The goal of this workshop is to provide a platform for researchers to present their latest work on knowledge-based compositional generalization and to foster discussions on the challenges and opportunities in this area. We invite researchers in AI, machine learning, statistics, cognitive sciences and neuroscience to submit their papers, posters, and demonstrations on any topic related to knowledge-based compositional generalization, including but not limited to:

- (Core topic) Representation learning for compositional generalization: How can we learn representations that are both expressive and amenable to generalization?
- (Core topic) Meta-learning for compositional generalization: How can we leverage past experience to improve
  generalization to novel compositions?
- (Core topic) Transfer learning for compositional generalization: How can we transfer knowledge between
  different domains or modalities to improve generalization?
- (Core topic) Reasoning for compositional generalization: How can we use reasoning to understand and
  generate novel combinations of concepts?
- (Core topic) Applications of knowledge-based compositional generalization: How can knowledge-based
  compositional generalization improve performance in specific application domains such as natural language
  processing, computer vision, and control systems?
- Learning compositional representations
- Combining knowledge from multiple sources
- Transfer learning and domain adaptation
- Compositional generalization in foundation models
- Compositional generalization in natural language understanding
- Compositional generalization in reinforcement learning
- Compositional generalization in knowledge representation and reasoning
- Relational machine Learning
- Using external knowledge for efficient machine learning
- Symbol grounding and Abstractions
- Benchmarks for compositional generalization
- Data visualization to study compositionality

We also welcome submissions from researchers working on related topics such as neural program synthesis, program
induction, and concept learning.

# instructions

Submissions should be in the form of a 7-page papers (+2-page references) for proceeding articles or a 2-page abstract for posters/demonstrations, and should be formatted according to the conferenceâ€™s guidelines (https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit). Accepted papers will be presented at the workshop and included in a workshop proceeding.

All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be presented as posters. The program committee will select a few papers for oral presentation. There will be a poster session during the scheduled coffee breaks to facilitate and spark discussions amongst attendees.

We look forward to your submissions and to seeing you at the workshop. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the organizing committee.

The submission website is on **[OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=ijcai.org/IJCAI/2023/Workshop/KBCG)**. Camera-ready versions are due by **June 15, 2023**, and will be posted on the workshop website.
